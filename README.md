> dotfiles <3 for ZSH and FISH

This setup was tested on Linux (openSUSE installation) and macOS 10.15.x.
The installation for ZSH is being deprecated (I'm moving to Fish shell due
to performance issues).

## Install & Setup

For `zsh`, use the following setup:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/earaujoassis/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ ~/dotfiles/bootstrap.zsh
```

For `fish`, use the following setup:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/earaujoassis/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ ~/dotfiles/bootstrap.fish
```
